		- Roman dates could appear mixed like California face
		- create an app for the Apple Watch
		- add support for new date picker
		- explain how the date is calculated
		- live preview of settings
		- drag and drop calendar events

			"Works very well, but FYI on Roman dates." by tullius – Mar 14, 2019
			Well, okay, it does exactly what it claims to do: convert a number string like “3-14-2019” to Roman numerals. So, yes, well done! But here’s the thing. If you want to tattoo that on your arm, it’s a free country, but that isn’t how Roman dates work. Roman dates are measured from 3 fixed days in the month; the kalends, nones, and ides. Today is the day before the Ides of March, and it’s the year 2772 since the founding of Rome. So today is “pridie Idus Martias ab urbe condita MMDCCLXXII”, or “prid. Id. Mar. MMDCCLXXII AUC”. Just FYI before you head to the tattoo parlor. Maybe check with a Latin teacher first. 🤔😉
	Bugs:
		- Remove darkmode since the UI doesn't work properly @done(2020-11-17)
		- Configuration changes no longer affect the converter view @done(2020-11-17)
			Quite simply, the view would make all the changes in viewDidAppear, but with modal viewing, viewDidAppear is no longer called
