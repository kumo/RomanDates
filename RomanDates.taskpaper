RomanDates:
	New Features:
		- Add donations like in Numbery and Roman Nums @na @done(2021-06-14)
	Ideas:
		- Add a widget to show current date (with font and colour configurations)
			Make a widget that is a colourful Roman Dates just like the thing I made for Instagram
		- Rewrite entire app in SwiftUI
		- Link to main Roman Nums app for extra information / cross promote
		- Configuration options for font and colours
		- Screenshot saving code should probably check for user permissions
		- Add Apple Watch app and complications
		- Info button could explain what is on the screen
		- Roman dates could appear mixed like California face
		- Add support for new date picker
		- Drag and drop calendar events
		- Show people with birthdays and anniversaries
		- Favourite the current date
		- Rewrite configuration code to support more-modern modal views
			The code expects that the converter view re-appears everytime the configuration is changed
		- Add support for "proper" Roman dates @request
			"Works very well, but FYI on Roman dates." by tullius – Mar 14, 2019
			Well, okay, it does exactly what it claims to do: convert a number string like “3-14-2019” to Roman numerals. So, yes, well done! But here’s the thing. If you want to tattoo that on your arm, it’s a free country, but that isn’t how Roman dates work. Roman dates are measured from 3 fixed days in the month; the kalends, nones, and ides. Today is the day before the Ides of March, and it’s the year 2772 since the founding of Rome. So today is “pridie Idus Martias ab urbe condita MMDCCLXXII”, or “prid. Id. Mar. MMDCCLXXII AUC”. Just FYI before you head to the tattoo parlor. Maybe check with a Latin teacher first. 🤔😉
	Bugs:
		- If date order is YMD and show year is turned off, MD should be selected instead @na
		- Save to image no longer works @done

	- 2021 icon @done
	- Add live view to settings @na @done(2020-11-22) @project(RomanDates / New Features)
		Use the SwiftUI code from my partial rewrite
	- Ensure that minimum version of iOS is suitable @na @done(2020-11-22) @project(RomanDates / Ideas)
		SwiftUI requires iOS 13
	- Remove darkmode since the UI doesn't work properly @done(2020-11-17) @project(RomanDates / Bugs)
	- Configuration changes no longer affect the converter view @done(2020-11-17) @project(RomanDates / Bugs)
		Quite simply, the view would make all the changes in viewDidAppear, but with modal viewing, viewDidAppear is no longer called
