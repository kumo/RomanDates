# RomanDates

Roman Dates allows you to quickly convert a date into Roman Numerals. You can decide which symbol (if any), appears between the parts of the date, and you can decide in which order the parts of the date appear.

## Installation

The easiest way is to download it from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/roman-dates/id912520382).

Or, you can [download](https://github.com/kumo/RomanDates/tags) the source code, compile it with Xcode, and install it on your iOS device.

If you choose to build it yourself, you will need to change the developer identity. And you will need to install and configure [RevenueCat](https://docs.revenuecat.com/docs/ios), or remove it.

## Notes

It was originally written in Objective-C, and now it is written in a combination of Swift and SwiftUI, but ideally it should be written in SwiftUI.
